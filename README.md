# Correlation-One Take Home Quiz APi Project

This project is made by me, for completing Correlation-One's study case



## API Documentation Link
Here is a link Postman Documentation that I have created  
https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16110993/UVyn2yyj


## Installing
You'll need gov1.14 or later in order to compile the code

Steps for compiling the code.

## Usage

I have included a database file (sqlite) that has seeded with 20 questions and some options for the questions.
Other than that I have included the postmen documentation above about the API.

## Last Words
Things I would (add|change|do better) if I had more time
- I would made the app lest depended on the database (change it to make less database requests)
- I would add security checks for the critical parts (JWT token at least).
- I would try to solve the remaining time attribute efficienly

These are all I can think of right now.
After my midterms I will try to imporve this project.
